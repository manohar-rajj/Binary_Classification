# Binary_Classification
This repository consists of a notebook where I have practiced Binary Classification and it's respective performance metrics. Also I have made use of sklearn.dataset concept as well to auto generate dataset for the the model. Furture to this the usage of hyperparameter tuning methods such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV are being done in this code file.
